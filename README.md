## Feature Denoising for Improving Adversarial Robustness

Code and models for the paper [Feature Denoising for Improving Adversarial Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.03411).

This repo contains:

1. Distributed adversarial training code on ImageNet.
2. Pre-trained models that achieve state-of-the-art adversarial robustness against targeted adversarial attack.
3. Evaluation script to verify the robustness of our models under white-box PGD attacks.

Please see [INSTRUCTIONS.md](INSTRUCTIONS.md) for the usage.
